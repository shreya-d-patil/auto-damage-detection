## 📖 **Methodology**

### 1️⃣ **Data Collection**
- **Sources:** Google Images, car repair shop websites, insurance company datasets
- **Types of Damage:**
  - 🚗 Dents
  - 🔧 Scratches
  - 🔥 Cracks
  - 🏗 Broken parts (bumpers, headlights, mirrors, etc.)

### 2️⃣ **Preprocessing & Model Training**
- **Data Cleaning:** Removing noise and irrelevant images
- **Image Augmentation:** Flipping, rotation, contrast adjustments for better model training
- **Model Used:** YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) for real-time object detection
- **Training:** Fine-tuned on a labeled dataset of vehicle damage images

### 3️⃣ **Damage Detection & Severity Analysis**
The model detects damaged areas and categorizes them based on severity:
- 🟢 Minor: Scratches, small dents
- 🟠 Moderate: Large dents, cracked parts
- 🔴 Severe: Heavy damage requiring full part replacement

### 4️⃣ **Cost Estimation**
Uses historical repair cost data and ML regression models to estimate repair costs.  
**Factors affecting cost estimation:**
- Severity level
- Car model & year
- Location-based labor costs

---

## 🔍 **Results & Performance**
- ✅ **High Accuracy:** 95%+ detection accuracy for vehicle damage classification
- ⏳ **Fast Processing:** Damage detection in under 2 seconds per image
- 🏆 **Improved Efficiency:** Automates damage assessment, reducing manual inspection time by 80%

---

## 📌 **Future Enhancements**
- 🔹 Integration with Insurance APIs for instant claim processing
- 🔹 3D Damage Visualization using depth estimation models
- 🔹 Mobile App Development for on-the-go assessments
- 🔹 Multi-language Support for wider accessibility
